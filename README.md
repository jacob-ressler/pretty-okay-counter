# A Pretty Okay Counter

This is a counter I made for some friends who shiny hunt on Twitch sometimes.

## Controls and Hotkeys

This application runs off of mouse and keyboard inputs, for the sake of simplicity on both the development and user ends.

### Mouse Controls

**Left Click** increments the counter by 1.
**Right Click** decrements the counter by 1.
**Middle Click** resets the counter to 0.

### Keyboard Controls

**S** opens a dialogue to set the counter value.
**R** resets the counter to 0.
**I** opens a dialogue to change the Pokemon image being displayed.
